Surgeon with special interests in information technology. Studied at the University of Nairobi and the University of Cape Town, South Africa. I have a great love for humanity. My deepest fulfillment is looking into the eyes of someone whose life I have made a little bit better - it is a feeling that you cannot put price tag on. My desire is to create pathways through which technology can improve healthcare delivery. Kenya is a developing nation but our people deserve first class healthcare. I believe that innovative use of technology can help us achieve that goal'.
